SwankyTS
==============

Only the swankiest tileset creator ever swanked.
SwankyTS is an ongoing project of mine to create such a swanky tileset creator that the work "swank" isn't even enough to describe it anymore.

Uh... Yeah.

On a more serious note, SwankyTS is my crack at creating a really nice, open source tileset creator that supports all the formats ever.

The code is mostly cleaned up now. A lot of the old, shitty code has been replaced with new, less shitty code. Now I can start working on adding new functionality to the editor and adding more file formats. Huzzah.
