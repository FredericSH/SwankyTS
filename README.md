SwankyTS
==============

Only the swankiest tileset creator ever swanked.
SwankyTS is an ongoing project of mine to create such a swanky tileset creator that the work "swank" isn't even enough to describe it anymore.

Uh... Yeah.

On a more serious note, SwankyTS is my crack at creating a really nice, open source tileset creator that supports all the formats ever.

Right now the code is pretty shit as it was hastily written for another project, and a lot of refactoring is going on right now to make it less shit. In a few months it will be pretty sexy, probably.
It also only exports to a proprietary format that I came up with on the fly for the aforementioned project. It will soon output more standardized formats.
